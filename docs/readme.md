# Arduino_MCHPTouch

This library allows you to read touch sensors values from the [Arduino MKR](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-wifi-1010) boards and the [Arduino Nano 33 IoT](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-iot). Touch sensing is a hardware capability of the SAMD21 processor.

This library allows to configure and read capacitive touch sensors, using MicroChip Technology ([Qtouch](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/libraries-code-examples-and-more/qtouch-tools))

With this you will be able to configure the sensing of the capacitive pad by changing the distance of reading.
Also it allows to get the values with an easy and handy way.

See the bundled [examples](examples/) for usage and visit the [Microchip Developer](https://microchipdeveloper.com/touch:start) website to learn more about touch sensing.


To use this library:

```
#include <Arduino_MCHPTouch.h>
```
