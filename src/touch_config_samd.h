 *
 * FREQ_MODE_SPREAD:

 * acquisition.
 *
 * FREQ_MODE_SPREAD_MEDIAN:
 * When frequency mode spread spectrum median option is selected,

 * FREQ_MODE_NONE:

/**
 * PTC acquisition frequency delay setting.
 *
 * Specify three frequency hop delay settings.
 *
 * The PTC acquisition frequency is dependent on the Generic clock
 * input to PTC and PTC clock pre-scaler setting.  This delay setting
 * inserts "n" PTC clock cycles between consecutive measurements on
 * a given sensor, thereby changing the PTC acquisition frequency.
 * FREQ_HOP_SEL_1 setting inserts 0 PTC clock cycle between consecutive
 * measurements.  FREQ_HOP_SEL_16 setting inserts 15 PTC clock cycles.
 * Hence, higher delay setting will increase the total time taken for
 * capacitance measurement on a given sensor as compared to a lower
 * delay setting.
 *
 * A desired setting can be used to avoid noise around the same frequency
 * as the acquisition frequency.
