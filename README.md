This library allows you to read touch sensors values from the [Arduino MKR](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-wifi-1010) boards and the [Arduino Nano 33 IoT](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-iot). Touch sensing is a hardware capability of the SAMD21 processor.

```c++
#include "Arduino_MCHPTouch.h"

void setup() {
    TOUCH.begin();
}

void loop() {
    TOUCH.poll();
    if (TOUCH.available()) {
        int value = TOUCH.read(0);  // read sensor 0
    }
}
```
